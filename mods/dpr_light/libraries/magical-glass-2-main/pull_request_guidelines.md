# MAGICAL GLASS 2 PULL REQUEST GUIDELINES
## Your PR will be rejected or a revision may be requested if it includes the following:
1. Exceeds the scope of the project, that being re-creating UNDERTALE's battle system with select deltarune mechanics.
2. A significant new feature without asking the project lead first.
3. An issue that has been assigned to someone else without asking permission.
4. Nothing that adds to the project (i.e. joke prs)

### NOTES
* The project lead, Sam/Idunno1 has the final say in which PRs are added and which ones are rejected.
* Don't ask for your PR to be merged. Sam will get to it in time.
