# Music2

Kristal library that rewrites Music to allow your funny
Deltarune-style music to have an intro before the loop

That said, if you aim for authenticity, I still suggest
using start-to-end looping like Deltarune

## Usage

First install the library by dropping it in your mod's `libraries`
folder

In assets/music, put in the intro segment of your track naming it
`<id>.ogg`, and put in the loop segment naming it `<id>.loop.ogg`.
Then it should Work:registered: unconditionally

## Known issues (v1.0.0)

Position mainpulation functions are in an awakard state, complain
to have it fixed
